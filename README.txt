Project was created to avoid visual studio intrinsic code instrumentation and optimizationYasm can compile ASM as is to binary code. This is required when cache level or Hardware specific optimizations are used.Using function pointers these functions gave about 16% increased speed when integrated to H264 encoder projectIn case your project does not use function pointers you should benchamrk the "call"" overhead versus code inlining.
